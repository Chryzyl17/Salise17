    <h1> My Testimony</h1>
    <div>
         <p1>
            Teaching in a 21ST Century students, it is important for an educator to meet the needs of the learners specially using technology as means of teaching strategy. I am grateful to be part of this collaboration between ALS and NBSC. As the ICT teacher in ALS, I realized that there were so many things I was not able to discuss the topic where they will be able to understand more about the topic.  
            Making webpage is the hardest part of the topic, I could not make myself focused since my seatmate always trying to ask questions instead of asking the instructor. Up until now, I could say I only learned maybe 50% of the topic. Moreover, I realized students will learn effectively if they have hands on activity. They will learn to navigate digital platforms with ease, where they will explore their skills in software applications, programming, and understanding of digital systems.
